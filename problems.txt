There were 100 contenders to the position of the Minister of Magic. Yet, there were two contenders who deserved the position the most -Albus Dumbledore and Martha Guniby. Yet both of them were contesting unwillingly, and did not want the position much. They couldn’t refuse to step down from the game, as a courtesy to wizarding community. Albus Dumbledore suggested a method, in which the position of the minister of magic could be a rolling one, so that all the 100 candidates got a chance to be the minister for 3 months. 
They arranged the contestants in a way such that every third person starting from 1 gets to be the Minister, in a cyclic manner. Where should Dumbledore initially place himself and his friend Martha so that they are the last ones to become the Minister? Write the positi­ons of Albus Dumbledore and Martha Guniby.

A young boy of 12 named Joey was in a playful mood. His mother had made him a pie- chocolate pie. He thought to play a game with the pie. Joey thought of a way to eat the entire pie with the throw of a die, a six-faced one, with numbers from 1-6. Suppose if a number n (n lies between 1 and 6) turns up, he will cut a piece equal to 1/n of the pie and eat it. He throws a die again and cuts a piece equal to 1/n of the remaining pie to eat. When will he finally finish eating the entire pie? If Joey gets tired midway and the pie is still not finished even after 11 throws of die, he thinks of eating the entire remaining pie at one go. In how many combinations could Joey have eaten the fraction of pie which he left at the 11th throw of die?
